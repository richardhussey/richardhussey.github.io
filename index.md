I am currently a senior data scientist working in the retail and marketing sector.  I am primarily interested in machine learning, evolutionary computation, and graph databases.

+ I am an experienced data scientist, analyst, and developer with 8 years in-depth, practical experience of large volume data analytics using products such as Alteryx and WPS/SAS, as well as lower-level analytical programming using Transact-SQL and Excel/VBA.  I have worked on both SQL (MS-SQL Server) and NoSQL (neo4j, MongoDB) databases.

+ I have extensive knowledge of machine learning approaches and technologies, allied with research into natural language processing and evolutionary computation.  This is coupled with a background in programming, primarily with Python, and augmented with experience in C#, R, and Ruby.

+ I have experience with mentoring junior colleagues and reporting on analytics and results to management and stakeholders.  I have extensive experience writing documentation and improving processes through standardisation and automation.
